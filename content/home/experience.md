# Analyzed the clinical applicability of digital retinal biomarkers in the detection of systemic disorders (such as Bipolar and Alzheimer’s) 
# Developed an explainable ML pipeline for the diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) and Hypertensive Retinopathy (HTR) using digital biomarkers extracted from the retinal vasculature. Python, OpenCV       
# Achieved ROC-AUC ∼ 0.70 for DR detection and stage-grading; 0.98 for HTR detection; 0.89 for HTR stage-grading
# Assessed the applicability of clinical AI in retinal imaging-based teleophthalmology services in India

# Developed a clinician-in-the-loop AI pipeline for the extraction and quantification of retinal vascular parameters with results within ±8% of the research benchmark tool SIVA. Python, OpenCV, Django
# Organized weekly brainstorming sessions for ideation, need analysis, and literature review on Dry Eye Disorder screening and anterior segment imaging
# Analyzed confounding factors in the grading criteria used by Retinopathy of Prematurity specialists and formulated a decision support system plan to address these issues

# Developed a test-case similarity search tool for impact analysis in software testing, with an accuracy of ∼ 95-98 %, that landed the first prize in Capgemini iSprint 2019 (West Division)
# Utilized NLP for tabular data processing and fine-tuned pre-trained ELMo (Embeddings from Language Models) to extract query and test-case embedding for semantic mapping
# D>esigned an interactive UI visualization scheme for the retrieved results using Python, t-SNE, and matplotlib
